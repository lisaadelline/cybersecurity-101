Cybersecurity 101 

Cybersecurity 101 is a 31-lesson seminar series I created and delivered at my school to introduce students — many with little or no technical background — to the world of cybersecurity.  
The lessons combine stories, real-world hacks, demos, and hands-on challenges to make cybersecurity intriguing, accessible, and memorable.
